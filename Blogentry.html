					<h3> WHAT IS COMPUTING? </h3>
						<p class="text-beside-image"> Most individuals use some form of computing every day. Either
							swiping a debit card, sending an email, or using a cell phone can all
							be considered forms of computing. I learn about the usage of computer and importance of computing as well as the Tech
							Timeline Research in which I even memorized every era. Computing, in a broad sense, refers to the use of computers and 
							computational techniques to process, manipulate, store, and communicate information. It encompasses a wide range of 
							activities and applications that involve the use of electronic devices to perform various tasks. The statement you 
							provided highlights the ubiquitous nature of computing in our daily lives and touches upon its diverse applications.
						</p>
					 
				
					<h3> PROFESSIONS AND CAREER IN COMPUTING</h3>
						<p class="text-beside-image"> In the field of computing, professionals encounter diverse career paths,
							spanning software development, data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence,
							machine learning, web development, and network administration. Specializations can include
							front-end or back-end development, database management, and system architecture, among others. In this module,
							I was challenged in choosing the career path I want to focus on, although I am really not sure yet,
							as long as I'll take the IT field then that would be enough for me.	The field of computing offers a vast array of 
							professions and career paths, providing individuals with opportunities to specialize in various areas.
							Here are some in demand list of IT career path:

					<h3>INFORMATION PROCESSING CYCLE </h3>
						<p class="text-beside-image">The Information Processing Cycle represents a sequential set of stages
							that computers adhere to when processing data to generate meaningful information. These stages include
							Input, Processing, Storage, Output, and Feedback. During the Input stage, raw data is entered into 
							the system using devices like keyboards, mice, or scanners. In the Processing stage, the computer 
							transforms the input data through arithmetic and logical operations performed by the Central Processing
							Unit (CPU). The processed information is then stored in memory during the Storage stage, utilizing 
							various storage devices such as RAM or hard drives. The Output stage involves presenting the processed
							information to the user through devices like monitors or printers. Finally, in the Feedback stage, the
							system uses the output to make improvements or adjustments, playing a crucial role in refining the 
							performance of the information processing cycle. These fundamental concepts provide a basis for
							understanding how computers and information systems function, with applications spanning computer 
							science, data analysis, and system design. In fields like computer programming and information systems
							management, this cycle serves as a foundational framework for optimizing data processing and system
							performance, ensuring efficient and effective handling of information.

					<h3> CONCEPTS OF COMPUTER SECURITY </h3>
						<p class="text-beside-image">
							The Concepts of Computer Security lesson provides a comprehensive exploration of fundamental topics crucial 
							for comprehending and implementing robust security measures. Commencing with an introductory overview, 
							the lesson underscores the significance of safeguarding computer systems, networks, and data in the digital
							landscape. It addresses the multifaceted nature of threats and vulnerabilities, delving into potential
							risks such as malware and social engineering techniques that exploit human psychology. By examining these 
							threats, the lesson equips learners with the knowledge needed to identify and counteract potential security breaches.
							A key emphasis throughout the lesson is on the dynamic and evolving nature of computer security. This recognition
							highlights the necessity for continuous awareness and adaptability to effectively respond to emerging threats 
							and vulnerabilities. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and the corresponding sophistication 
							of cyber threats, the lesson underscores the importance of staying abreast of the latest security developments.
							This proactive approach is essential in maintaining a secure computing environment that can withstand evolving challenges.
							Moreover, the lesson likely delves into various security measures and practices, such as encryption, access controls,
							and intrusion detection systems. These tools and techniques contribute to the establishment of a multi-layered defense
							strategy, fortifying the resilience of computer systems against a wide array of potential security breaches.

					<h3> BASIC HTML and CSS </h3>
						<p class="text-beside-image">Basic HTML and CSS serve as foundational technologies for web development, playing integral
							roles in creating and styling web pages. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the backbone of the World Wide Web.
							It is the standard markup language used to structure content on the internet. Through a system of tags and attributes, 
							HTML allows web developers to define the various elements of a web page, encompassing text, images, links, forms, and more.
							By employing these tags, developers can organize and arrange content in a way that browsers can interpret and display.
							On the other hand, Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a stylesheet language closely intertwined with HTML. While HTML dictates
							the structure of web content, CSS is responsible for describing its presentation and styling. CSS provides a set of rules that
							determine the layout, appearance, and formatting of HTML documents. The term "Cascading" in CSS refers to the hierarchy of 
							styles, allowing developers to apply global styles while also providing the flexibility to override or modify styles for 
							specific elements. This separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) enhances the maintainability and scalability 
							of web development projects. In essence, HTML and CSS work in tandem to create visually appealing and well-structured web
							pages. HTML establishes the basic building blocks and content structure, while CSS adds the aesthetic layer, ensuring a 
							consistent and visually pleasing presentation across multiple pages. This separation of concerns simplifies the development
							process, making it more efficient and facilitating updates and modifications to the appearance of a website without altering
							its underlying structure. For anyone embarking on web development, a solid understanding of HTML and CSS is fundamental,
							serving as the cornerstone for more advanced web technologies and frameworks.
